    Unlike a wiki article, a raw document is not required to carry frontmatter --
    and a malformed one must not make the document unselectable, only unlabelled.
    So where update_markdown_index skips, this degrades to ({}, whole content).

    Leading HTML comments are skipped before parsing: ``distill`` prepends
    ``<!-- source: ... -->`` to every file it ingests (``distill.py:82``), which
    pushed each document's own frontmatter off line 0 and left the whole catalog
    without a date, without a source and titled by filename -- 0 of 108 lines
    carried a date on the reference KB. Skipped here rather than widened into
    split_frontmatter so only raw documents get the looser contract: extraction
    files and articles are written by this package and are always
    frontmatter-first, and a phantom delimiter on that path truncates a payload
    (see storage/extraction.py's B3a/B6a).

    The skip is adopted only when it reveals a mapping, because a comment above a
    horizontal rule would otherwise read the first paragraph as frontmatter and
    return a body missing everything above the second rule. Losing content is
    worse than the labels this recovers. Two bounds on that guard, both inherited
    from what a raw document already means here rather than introduced by the skip:
    a rule-delimited block whose own lines parse as a mapping (``From:``/``Date:``
    export headers) is consumed like frontmatter, exactly as it already is in a
    document that has no comment; and when no mapping is found the comments stay in
    the returned body, so a document with neither frontmatter nor an extraction can
    still show one as its first-paragraph summary.
