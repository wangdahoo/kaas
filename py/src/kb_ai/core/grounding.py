"""A read-only check for names an article asserts that no source of it contains.

Issue #42. Compiling go-zero produced a `MiddlewaresConf` table with an `Auth`
field the framework does not declare and the real `Shedding` renamed `Shedder`,
plus a numbered "applied in this order" middleware chain that appeared in no
extraction at all. The list was 9 of 11 correct, which is the tell: content drawn
from the model's own knowledge of a popular framework rather than from the
material. At query time the fabricated prose beat the correct table in 5 of 5
samples, so this is worse than an omission -- it looks complete enough that nobody
goes looking for the extraction that lost the enumeration (#41).

The grounding constraint in core/merge.py asks the writer not to do it. This is
the part that can tell whether it stopped, and it works on a knowledge base
already on disk rather than only on the next compile.

Reports and never spends: no LLM call, no network, nothing rewritten. Same
contract as the two checks in derive/_status.py.

## What it can and cannot see

Every rule below trades recall for precision, because an operator who meets one
false positive in a 181-article report stops reading the list. That is a bias, not
a promise of a short report: on the reference knowledge base this reports 108
names, and most of them are sound -- see the measurement at the end. The bounds are
deliberate rather than pending:

- A candidate must be a *code span* or *shaped* like an identifier (an internal
  capital, an underscore, a qualifying dot). A bare `Auth` in a table cell is
  invisible to this check, being indistinguishable from the word "Auth" in a
  sentence. Bold does not qualify either: it is how a generated article labels an
  ordinary bullet, and trusting it reported `No`, `Note` and `Acquires`.
- Only table rows and list items are scanned -- the shapes that make a claim about
  a named thing. Fabrication inside a paragraph is out of scope.
- Fenced code blocks are skipped: quoted code is reformatted on the way into an
  article, so a name's absence from the extraction is weaker evidence there.
- Matching is case-insensitive, so a name whose letters appear in the material in
  any casing is treated as sourced.
- An article is skipped, not flagged, when any extraction it names is unreadable.
  Against a partial haystack every name from the missing document reads as
  fabricated, which is a report about the extraction layer (F3's job).

Set membership is the whole mechanism, which bounds what it can find. Of the two
instances in #42 it sees the first -- the invented `Auth`, and `Shedding` renamed
`Shedder` -- and cannot see the second by construction: every member of the
fabricated middleware chain was individually present in the material, and what was
wrong there was the *ordering* and the two omissions. Neither is a membership
question.

Measured against the 181-article go-zero knowledge base from the issue: 108 names
across 55 articles, both #42 field-table findings among them. Around four fifths of
the rest are real identifiers that the document contains and its extraction does
not, so they are true of what this checks and still not inventions -- that is #41
surfacing here, and a re-extract is the answer to both. Expect the ratio to invert
on a knowledge base extracted after #41.
