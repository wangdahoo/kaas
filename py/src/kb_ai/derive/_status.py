"""Two read-only checks over a knowledge base's extraction layer (spec F3, F5).

They answer different questions, and both are needed:

- ``check_extractions`` (F3) asks "does this KB's extraction match its own
  document" -- internal consistency. It is the read-side counterpart of the guard
  copy_documents applies, and it is what makes keying extractions by path safe.
- ``check_parent`` (F5) asks "has the parent's version of this document moved
  since I was derived" -- divergence from the source. A derived KB can pass F3 and
  still be months behind.

Both report and never spend: no LLM call, no network, and nothing is rewritten.
Refreshing a derived KB when its source changes stays out of scope, and spending
money on a read path is excluded by design.
