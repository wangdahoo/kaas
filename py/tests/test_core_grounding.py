"""Tests for the grounding check: names an article asserts that no source has.

Issue #42. Compiling go-zero produced a `MiddlewaresConf` table with an `Auth`
field the framework does not declare, and a numbered middleware chain that
appeared in no extraction. Both read as authoritative, and at query time the
fabricated prose beat the correct table in 5 of 5 samples. The prompt constraint
in core/merge.py asks the writer not to do it; this is the part that can tell
whether it stopped.

Two properties matter more than breadth here. It must catch the shapes #42
produced -- a table row and an ordered list of named items -- and it must stay
quiet on ordinary prose, because an operator who meets one false positive in a
181-article report stops reading the list.

`RestConf` is the top-level configuration. See [[Rest Engine Core]].

## Fields

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `Shedding` | bool | load shedding |
| `Timeout` | int | per-route deadline |

## API

| Signature | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| `Set(val bool)` | stores the value |
| `func NewServer(c RestConf) *Server` | builds the server |

## Semantics

- **No torn reads**: the value is read or written indivisibly.
- **Thread-safe** access via `sync.RWMutex`.
1. **Acquires** the lock, i.e. no goroutine proceeds.
2. **Compute** the new value (`old + val`).
- e.g. a request over `MaxBytes` is rejected.
